"When you hand someone a GameFace, it stops being a micro:bit, and starts being something else; a standalone product in its own right, engineered by young people."

# Overview

This is an overall heading for BBC micro:bit workshops, which I'm calling **GameFace**. As the name suggests, it's a games-based project. The workshops collectively cover electronics, programming, and fabrication.

# Games so far

* By far the most popular game so far is Quick Bit. It's a 30 line game written in Python, testing speed of reactions. It works really well with a modular case design, and is suitable for one-day workshops.

* Button bit uses arcade buttons, and tests the reactions of multiple players.

* I'm a way of developing it properly, but I've written up a set of rules for a multiple room-wide game based on balancing micro:bits and running around a room.
